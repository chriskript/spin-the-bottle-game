<h2>📃 About the Project</h2>
<p>This project is a fun, interactive simulation of a classic "Spin the Bottle" game. Each click of the "Spin" button randomly rotates the bottle, using JavaScript to generate the rotation angle and CSS transitions for smooth spinning. It’s a great way to learn how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive experiences on the web.</p>
